            Calculates what percentage of loans are recovered against the investor funding and the total amount funded currently.

        future_loan_recovery(self):
            Calculates what percentage of loans would be recovered against the investor funding and the total amount funded 6 months in the future.

        def loan_recovery_graphs(self):
            A bar chart representing what percentage of loans are recovered against the investor funded and the total amount funded currently and in 6 months.

        losses_calc(self):
            Calculates what percentage of loans are a loss to the company and the total amount that was paid towards these loans before being charged off.

            Visualises the projected loss for charged off loans.

        at_risk_customers_calculation(self):
            Calculates the percentage of clients behind on their loans, total number of these clients, how much loss company would incur if their loans were charged off
        and projected loss if clients were to finish full term of loan.

        at_risk_customers_visualisation(self):
            Visualises the at_risk_customers_calculation() calculations.

        create_subset(self):
            Creates subset of users who may not be able to pay off their loans.
